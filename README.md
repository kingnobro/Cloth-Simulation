### Implementation

1. Cloth Simulation based on Mass-Spring System
2. High Efficiency Collision Detection
3. Constrained Delaunay Triangulation
4. Parsing Cloth Data from `.dxf` and Sewing them together.



### Build

You need to make following modifications in Visual Studio,

- INCLUDE
- LIB
- Additional Dependencies: `glfw3.lib`, `assimp-vc142-mt.lib`
- Preprocessor Definitions: `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`



### Future Work

- Cloth Self Collision
- Multilayer Cloth Simulation
